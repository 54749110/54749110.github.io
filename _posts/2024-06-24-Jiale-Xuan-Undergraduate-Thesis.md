##  Brief Introduction
---
&emsp;&emsp; In this undergraduate thesis, I mainly conducted technical work and analyzed physical systems through programming. I developed DMRG and ED programs to deal with the two-channel Kondo model, reproducing and studying the entangled properties within it through entanglement entropy and electron negativity. To be honest, I didn't come to any particularly interesting conclusions, but I learned a great deal of technical skills and methods for physics research, including tensor networks, DMRG, and so on. This work was truly a labor of love for me. The research results I achieve in the next three years of my master's program may not be related to this, but this serves as a starting point.
